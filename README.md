# 🎓 Student Outcome Prediction — ML Classification Model

A machine learning project that predicts whether a university student will **Pass** or **Fail** based on behavioral, demographic, and assessment data from the **Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD)**.

Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application**.

## 📊 Results

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 82% |
| Random Forest (GridSearchCV) | **85%** ✅ |

## 🗂️ Dataset

This project uses the **OULAD** dataset — a real-world open education dataset from the UK Open University.

📥 **Download the dataset here:**  
[Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD) — Google Drive](https://share.google/xWOBKfXZOkKIAWv8q)

Place all CSV files in the **root project folder** before running.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `studentInfo.csv` | Demographics & final outcomes |
| `studentVle.csv` | Student activity logs (10M+ rows) |
| `studentAssessment.csv` | Assessment scores |
| `studentRegistration.csv` | Registration & withdrawal info |
| `courses.csv` | Course-level info |
| `assessments.csv` | Assessment metadata |
| `vle.csv` | Virtual learning environment tools |

## ⚙️ Project Pipeline

### 1. Data Loading & Exploration
- Loaded 7 CSV files using Pandas
- Explored shapes, data types, and null values

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Filled missing `imd_band` values with `"Unknown"`
- Dropped rows with missing assessment scores
- Encoded `gender` and `disability` as binary (0/1)
- Filtered to binary classification: **Pass / Fail** (excluded Withdrawn)
- One-hot encoded: `region`, `highest_education`, `imd_band`, `age_band`

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Total Clicks** — sum of VLE interactions per student
- **Average Score** — mean assessment score per student
- **Days Active** — number of unique active days in VLE
- **Withdrawal Flag** — whether student unregistered

### 4. Model Training
- Applied **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance
- 80/20 stratified train-test split
- Trained: Logistic Regression & Random Forest
- Optimized Random Forest via **GridSearchCV** (n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split)

### 5. Deployment
- Saved best model using `joblib`
- Built interactive **Streamlit app** for real-time prediction

## 🚀 How to Run

### Step 1 — Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2 — Run the ML pipeline
```bash
python student.py
```
This will train the model and generate:
- `student_model.pkl`
- `model_features.pkl`
- `main_df_final_powerbi.csv`

### Step 3 — Launch the Streamlit app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
